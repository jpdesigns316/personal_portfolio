# Personal Portfolio Porject
This was my second project as part of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree
at Udacity.com. 

# Why I list myself as Graphic Designer?
Prior to this class I had taken courses in Graphic Web Design. I am proficient
in working with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I have listed as part of my
portfolio some of the projects which I had done using Adobe Illustrator.

# Why I list myself as a programmer?
Because I know how to write code. I like to code and not in one particular
language. Right now, I am proficient in Python and Java. Through this course
I hope learn how to write things in Javascript (which ironically has nothing
to do with Java), and have dabbled in learning PHP and SQL.
